This is a tool for a game called [Grey Hack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/605230/Grey_Hack/).
It is currently in alpha, so you can help this project by contributing to it

# Building
To build this project you will need a few tools:
  1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - text editor with vast support for different languages
  1. [Greybel VS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ayecue.greybel-vs) - VS Code extension allowing for various things related with GreyScript (programming language within Grey Hack)
  1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - most popular version control system

## Building Process:
### External Part
- Clone this repository by using `git clone https://github.com/Some-O-ne/Sugoi`
- Open VS Code in project's folder
- Open `main.gs` in editor
- Right click anywhere in file and Press `Greybel: Build`
- If everything has been done right, then there should appear a `build` folder
> [!NOTE]
> Currently the `Greybel: Import file into the game` functionality doesn't work, so you will have to manually copy each installation file into Grey Hack
- Copy each installerX.src into Grey Hack
### Grey Hack Part
- build and run each installerX.src file with root rights
- Execute `cd /root`
- Execute `sudo build main.gs <Your desired location>`
- Optionally, you can delete all files generated by installers as they're not needed

# Getting Started
  Optionally, you can create `init.sugoi` file at `/home/<Your Username>/Config` with commands which will get executed at the start of runtime. This is useful for Atlases, Custom Presets and more
